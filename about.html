<p>
I'm a junior physics major at <a href="http://hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in Claremont, CA. I'm interested in materials engineering, computational modeling, and new additive manufacturing technologies.
</p>

<p>
Outside of my studies, I enjoy woodworking, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and making music.
