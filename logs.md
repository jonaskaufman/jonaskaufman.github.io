For our senior project in high school, my friend Brendan and I made some rustic log furniture out of trees felled by Hurricane Sandy.

First we made two small benches out of a poplar log that we split with wedges. After resawing on the bandsaw and evening out the surfaces on the planer, we attached legs made from birch branches.

We also made two larger benches out of a piece of white ash. Each half was planed flat and rested on top of short logs with notches cut into them with a chainsaw.

The last piece was a simple coffee table made from a maple stump that we basically just flipped upside down.
